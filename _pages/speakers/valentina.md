**[Valentina Zantedeschi](https://vzantedeschi.com/)** is a Senior Research Scientist at ServiceNow, Adjunct Professor at Laval University of Quebec and member of the ELLIS Society. Her research focuses on building ML models that are inherently interpretable via latent discrete structures, with applications in remote sensing, time-varying modelling and causal discovery. Previously, she was a post-doctoral researcher at INRIA and University College London, and a researcher at the European Space Agencyâ€™s funded FDL research accelerator, where she developed weather forecasting and change detection AI models. Valentina holds a PhD from Jean Monnet University (France), with a thesis on data-dependent kernel learning with generalization guarantees, for which she received the best thesis award 2019 from the French Society for AI (AFIA). As a research intern at IBM, Dublin, she wrote the codebase of the initial release of Adversarial Robustness Toolbox, a widely deployed library for analyzing the robustness of AI models to adversarial examples.
