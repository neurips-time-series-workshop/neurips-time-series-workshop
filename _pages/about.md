In recent years the success of large language models (LLMs) has sparked exciting research in various domains ranging from
audio/image
processing over reinforcement learning to the development general-purpose virtual assistants such as
ChatGPT.

**In our first workshop at the <a href="https://neurips.cc/">38th annual
Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)</a>** ,  we aim to better understand the impact of LLMs on
time-series prediction and the
challenges that come with adopting large models to this domain.

Key topics of this workshop include but are not limited to:

- Foundation models for time-series prediction
- Leveraging/adopting pretrained models of other modalities for more accurate prediction of longitudinal data 
- Multimodal Time Series Models
- Real world Applications of time-series prediction/analysis 
- Exploring new datasets and metrics for benchmarking alternative time-series predictions
