This workshop will delve into aspects of time series prediction and analysis in the age of large models. We will focus on works that address:

* Building Foundation Models for Time Series: Despite the success of foundation models in other modalities most deep learning models for time series prediction still operate in the standard regime of training and prediction on a single dataset, on a single task. Here we encourage works that seek to understand the progress so far as well as potential challenges in developing such models.

* Leveraging Pretrained Models of Other Modalities for Time Series:  Pretrained large language models (LLMs) have shown extensive promise when adapted to other modalities (such as vision)  and similarly we encourage works that explore the potential of adapting LLMs to time series data.

* Multimodal Time Series Models: Most time-series models in the literature are restricted to only handle numerical time-series data. In this segment of the workshop, we seek to discuss the challenges involved in building multimodal time-series models that can handle multiple types of data.

* Time Series Evaluation and Real-World Applications: We will also discuss the challenges and shortcommings in evaluating time series models and the potential real-world applications of large models in time series prediction and analysis.
