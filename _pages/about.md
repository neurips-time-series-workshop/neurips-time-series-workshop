This workshop focuses on the advancements and challenges in time-series prediction and analysis in the era of large
models. It aims to address specific problems in this field, highlighting the following areas:

1. **Foundation Models for Time Series**
- Understanding progress and challenges in developing foundation models (FMs) for time series.
- Exploring design choices, data diversity, as well as evaluation benchmarks.

2. **Leveraging Pretrained Models of Other Modalities**
- Using large language models (LLMs) time for series tasks.
- Methods of adapting pretrained LLMS
- Adapting pretrained models for other modalities (e.g., audio, video, images).

3. **Multimodal Time Series Models**
- Integrating multiple data modalities (numerical, text, images) for improved analysis and prediction.
- Building text-conditioned forecasting models and exploring causal relationships in time series.

4. **Time Series Evaluation and Real-World Applications**
- Addressing shortcomings in current evaluation metrics.
- Developing new metrics for evaluating (probabilistic) predictions.
- Showcasing applications in domains like retail, transportation, finance, human mobility, climate and weather.
