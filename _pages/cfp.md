We welcome researchers working in the field of time series analysis to submit their latest original research work to the NeurIPS 2024 workshop on **Time Series in the Age of Large Models**.

## Key Information

- Submission link: [TBD](https://openreview.net)
- Submission deadline: Sep 15, 2024 (11:59 pm AoE)
- Acceptance notification: Oct 14, 2024
- Camera ready deadline: Nov 25, 2024

## Submission Instructions

Submissions should take the form of a short paper of up to **4 pages**. Additional pages containing references and appendices are allowed but the reviewers are _not obliged_ to refer to the appendices when reviewing the paper. Submissions should be made on **[Open Review]()** in a single `.pdf` file using **[this LaTeX style template](../assets/latex/timeseries-workshop-latex-template.zip)**. The review process in _double-blind_, so please ensure that your submission is properly anonymized. Papers that exceed the page limit or have not been properly anonymized will be rejected without review.

All accepted submissions will be accompanied by a poster presentation. A number of selected submissions will be invited for lightning and oral talks. 

**Dual submission policy**: This workshop is **non-archival**; even though all accepted papers will be available on OpenReview and this website, there are no formally-published proceedings. If a paper is currently under review at another venue, it can still be submitted to this workshop. If a paper has previously appeared in a journal, workshop, or conference (including papers accepted to NeurIPS 2024 conference), it should be reasonably extended in order to be accepted at this workshop.

## Scope and Topics

We invite submissions related to pretrained time series models. The key topics include (but are not limited to):

- Building _foundation_ models for time series data.
- Analyzing existing pretrained time series models (e.g., explainability and interpretability).
- Critiques on foundation models for time series.
- Faster and better inference schemes for autoregressive pretrained time series models.
- Leveraging pretrained models of other modalities for time series.
- Multimodal time series models.
- Large scale evaluation benchmarks, live (continuously updating) datasets, synthetic data generation and data augmentation for time series.
- Time series evaluation (e.g. analysis and development of metrics for (probabilistic) forecasting, multivariate forecasting, use-case motivated metrics etc.)
- Real-world applications of large time series models.
